Implement a Weapon class that has:
•A private attribute type, which is a string.
•A getType() member function that returns a constant reference to typeweapon.
•A setType() member function that sets type using the new value passed as a pa-
rameter.
Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB. They both have a Weapon and
a name. They also have a member function attack() that displays (without the angle
brackets):
<name> attacks with their <weapon type>
HumanA and HumanB are almost identical except for these two small details:
•While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB does not.
•HumanB may not always have a weapon, whereas HumanA will always be
armed.
If your implementation is correct, executing the following code will print an attack
with "crude spiked club" followed by a second attack with "some other type of club" for both test cases:

```
int main(){
    {
        Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
        HumanA bob("Bob", club);
        bob.attack();
        club.setType("some other type of club");
        bob.attack();
    }
    {
        Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
        HumanB jim("Jim");
        jim.setWeapon(club);
        jim.attack();
        club.setType("some other type of club");
        jim.attack();
    }
    return 0;
}

```

In which case do you think it would be best to use a pointer to
Weapon? And a reference to Weapon? Why? Think about it before
starting this exercise.
